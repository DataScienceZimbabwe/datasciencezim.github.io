# Welcome to Data Science Zimbabwe 
###### An initiative to bring together students, academics and professionals that are interested in using data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence to advance Zimbabwean opportunities and mould African solutions to African problems.  

## About us______________ 

#### The organization was started with a mind to embrace the use of data that have become very prevalent in our society. Using the data to fuel insights that can be used to come up with solutions that are sustainable for the issues faced in our communities and country.   

#### We would like to encourage the use of data science tools and techniques to lead decision making and make available to all that are interested in data science, pathways and tutorials, opportunities and knowledge of the related fields, with a Zimbabwean and African context.   

#### We also aspire to bring about an appreciation of advanced technologies, to help bridge the gaps of disparities between advanced economies and Zimbabwe and Africa, through efforts to instil a passion for computing technologies, aligned with data science and machine learning, in the populace. We hope to be a platform for collaboration with a greater global community as well as for different disciplines/fields within Zimbabwe.
